* Syntax

N ::= -TKa*
   \vert  N, N (multiple codes)
   \vert  N; N (sequential codes)
   \vert  N\vert N (alternative codes)

* Types of things being composed

| Code | Description                                 |
|------+---------------------------------------------|
| M    | external Manufacturer instruction set       |
| P    | external Protocol reference                 |
| L    | internal/implicit Lab protocol reference    |
| E    | internal/implicit Equipment instruction set |

* Kinds of composition

| Code | Description                                                                    |
|------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A    | pArallel step (do this while\dots)                                                 |
| B    | Branching step (do this then come back to the next step\dots)                      |
| R    | pRe-processing step (do this before\dots)                                          |
| S    | Sequencing (Branching, but specified externally, not in the branched-from step |

* External protocol references that are not composition

| Code | Description                                                     |
|------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| X    | Derivation: this protocol was created by modifying some other   |
| C    | Comparison: this protocol is same/different from some other     |
| I    | Information: Protocol listed as background information for user |

* additional composition information

| Code | Description                                                |
|------+------------------------------------------------------------|
| m    | apply the composition with modifications                   |
| h(%) | file name for composed item                                |


* Coding notes

1) In some protocols, <R> recipes are listed at the end of the document; in others they're not in our PDF but
in an appendix.  I've treated them all as though they're external, for consistency.  I don't think it's
relevant to our research questions that CSHP has changed the layout of their issue in this way; the user still
has to do the same function of combining recipes with the protocol

2) When Discussion kind of sections talk about other academic references in relation to this protocol,
it's not always clear whether the refs are other protocols you can compare or combine with this one, or
just academic discussions of the issues involved.  I've tried to guess based on the text, but these decisions
may not be very reliable.

3) The I code may reiterate some steps in the protocol in more detail; so it might just
be counted as an "A" code, but we don't have it in front of us to check.
