49. The next day, count the number of blue and white colonies in the bacterial plates from samples immunoprecipitated with the specific antibody as well as the controls (i.e., no antibody or IgG).

White colonies represent bacteria-harboring plasmids with inserts, whereas blue colonies represent bacteria with plasmids without the insert.

i

* Anchored Note, page 7
In an ideal 6C experiment, the number of white colonies should be several- fold higher in samples immunoprecipitated with the specific antibody than in controls.
