9. Filter the mixture through a 100-μm nylon mesh. Using a spatula, transfer the peels from the mesh into 10 mL of enzyme solution 1.

15. Filter the solution containing the protoplasts through a 30-μm nylon mesh to remove debris. Using a squirt bottle, wash the mesh with ~5 mL of basic solution. Collect both the filtrate and the wash solution into a centrifuge tube.

:AP1

16. Centrifuge the solution containing the protoplasts at 800 rpm for 5 min to pellet the protoplasts. Decant the supernatant.

17. Gently resuspend the pellet in 15 mL of basic solution. Repeat Step 16.

Patch clamping should always be performed with pipettes prepared on the same day.

19. Pull each glass capillary tube into two pipettes using a two-step puller. Set the temperature for each step properly to make sure the tip of the pipette is sharp and thin, with a tip opening of <1 μm.

:AP1

* Anchored Note, page 4
20. Smooth the sharp tip of the pipette by polishing the tip with a microforge. Stop heating the tip when the tip opening becomes very small.

:AP1

* Anchored Note, page 4
21. Store the polished pipettes mounted on a clay strip in a covered dish to avoid contamination and clogging of the pipette tip.

:AP1i

* Anchored Note, page 4
The seal resistance of the pipette should be 40-60 MΩ using the described patch clamping solutions.

22. Fill the cell chamber with bath solution. Add 20 μL of the protoplast solution (from Step 18). Wait 5 min to allow the protoplasts to settle to the bottom of the chamber (Fig. 2F).

24. Turn on the amplifier and computer. Load pCLAMP software (Clampex) for whole cell data acquisition. Load or edit the proper parameters to set the voltage family to evaluate guard cell K+ channels:

:AP1ivx

* Anchored Note, page 4
i. A typical voltage family for inward and outward K+ channel current recordings consists of negative and positive voltages (e.g., -200 mV to +80 mV with 20-mV increments).

i

See the waveform example in Fig. 3.

v

* Anchored Note, page 4
ii. Set the duration to no less than 4 sec for each voltage step to make sure the currents reach steady state, with a holding potential of -60 mV and an interpulse interval of 6 sec.

25. Heat the tip of the plastic syringe using an alcohol burner. Pull the syringe into a very thin tube with a diameter <0.5 mm.

:AP1

* Anchored Note, page 4
26. Using the syringe, fill a glass pipette with pipette solution. Remove air bubbles by flicking the pipette.

:AP1i

* Anchored Note, page 4
Air bubbles can cause an open circuit, preventing recording of the current.

27. Tighten the pipette into the holder, making sure that only 1-2 mm of the Ag/AgCl electrode wire is submerged in the pipette solution.

29. Use the coarse manipulator to move the glass pipette so that its tip is centered over the protoplast and above the surface of the bath solution.

:AP1

* Anchored Note, page 5
30. Reduce the light intensity of the microscope so that it is easier to find the shadow of the pipette tip. While observing using a 10X objective, use the coarse manipulator to move the pipette down until the tip is above and very close to the selected protoplast.

To avoid clogging the pipette tip, maintain positive pressure by blowing into the tube that is connected to the electrode holder.

31. While maintaining positive pressure, change to the 40X objective. Use the fine micromanipulator to move the pipette so that it gently touches the protoplast, very slightly deforming it.

32. Apply gentle suction to the tube so that the tip of the glass pipette seals onto the protoplast.

* Anchored Note, page 5
33. Continue to apply suction. Set the pipette offset to zero. Monitor the increase in the seal resist- ance on the computer. Gradually apply a more negative holding potential (-10 mV for each 100 MΩ increase in seal resistance) to -60 mV.

34. When a GΩ seal resistance is reached, give a stronger pulse of suction and/or a voltage zap from the patch clamp amplifier.

This breaks the membrane and forms the whole-cell configuration.

and 5 GΩ can also be used if leak (instantaneous) currents are not too large. For recording of single channel currents from membrane patches, seal resistances of at least 10 GΩ are required in order to achieve a suitable signal-to-noise ratio.
