2. Euthanize P6 Long-Evans rats using a CO2 chamber.

To prevent having more than a few minutes lag time between the euthanasia and removal of the cerebella, con- sider doing this step in two parts.

3. Decapitate pups. To isolate the cerebella, begin by grasping a pup head at the nose and insert small surgical scissors into the foramen magnum (the aperture at the base of the skull through which the medulla and spinal cord extend). Proceed laterally, then anteriorly through the ear, and curve toward the midline. After reaching the midline from one side, reinsert scissors into the fora- men magnum, and repeat the cutting procedure on the other side.

4. Using forceps, carefully lift the skull upward, and flip it back until the hindbrain is exposed (Fig. 1A). Make sure that, as the skull is lifted, the brain remains in the base of the skull.

5. If necessary, cut away any bone or other tissues that are obstructing the sides of the cerebellum. Extract the cerebellum with forceps (Fig. 1B), and place it into a dish containing at least 5 mL of HHGN dissection solution.

6. After isolation of the cerebella, use the dissection scope and fine forceps to remove the meninges, as well as any large blood vessels or extraneous brain regions that are stuck to the cerebella.

:AP1ax

* Anchored Note, page 2
This step should be performed at a steady pace, with a plate of ice underneath the plate of cerebella.

* Anchored Note, page 2
The meninges tend to come off most easily if you start by pulling away residual choroid plexus from the ventral side, where the fourth ventricle was located.

If you are working with two litters, an additional step of trituration is helpful; see Step 11.iv.

7. Working in the tissue culture hood, decant the dish of cerebella into a 50-mL Falcon tube. Use a pipette to remove most of the HHGN solution, and then add at least 5 mL of fresh HHGN solu- tion. Repeat this for a total of three washes.

:AP1ar(11.iv)

* Anchored Note, page 3
8. After removing the last HHGN wash, add 5 mL of trypsin-DNase solution, being sure to first mix the solution by pipetting up and down. Place the tube in a 37°C water bath for 10 min. Gently swirl the cerebella every 5 min.

i. For approximately the first 15 rounds of pipetting, do not press the pipette tip against the very bottom of the tube; rather, allow the cerebella to fall apart into smaller chunks.

After approximately 10 more rounds of pipetting, you will find that the pieces of tissue are not becoming any smaller.

iii. Press the pipette tip more firmly against the bottom of the tube, and continue the tritura- tion until clumps of tissue are no longer visible.

:AP1

* Anchored Note, page 3
iv. To perform an additional trituration, transfer the cell suspension to ice for 5 min, allowing any remaining undetected clumps to sink to the bottom. Transfer the top half of the cell solu- tion to a separate Falcon tube, and triturate the bottom again using fresh DNase solution.

13. Use a pipette to remove the supernatant. Add 5 mL of culture medium for granule neurons, and pipette up and down until a homogeneous mixture is obtained. Add 10 mL more of culture medium incrementally, pipetting up and down after dispensing every 2-3 mL to ensure that the mixture remains homogeneous.

14. Place the cell suspension on ice, and count a small aliquot using a hemacytometer:

:AP1; AQ1

* Anchored Note, page 4
i. Make a 1:10 dilution of cells by adding 100 μL of the cell suspension to 650 μL of culture medium and 250 μL of trypan blue.

ii. Count healthy, spherical cells with a halo. Do not count cells that take up the trypan blue.
