1. Using a sterile toothpick, transfer cells of the yeast strain of interest to each of the plates listed below. Gently touch the toothpick containing cells to the center of each plate. On a separate set of plates, transfer cells of mutant strain defective for mat formation (a negative control; e.g., flo11Δ).

0.3% agar is optimal to observe colony spreading. On these plates, colonies can show a radial spoke pattern.

2% agar is optimal to observe mat architecture. It also allows assessment of invasive growth by the plate- washing assay

4% agar is optimal to observe colony ruffling and z-axis growth (see Fig. 1). The high surface rigidity reduces expansion in the plane of the xy-axis and promotes formation of dense architecturally complex mats that grow upward in the plane of the z-axis.

2. Maintain the plates in a 30 ̊C incubator in a location where vibrations are minimized. Examine mat expansion visually starting at 24 h and continuing over the course of several weeks.

Mats can be defined by their FLO11-dependent colony architecture and degree of expansion in the x-, y-, and z-axes by visual inspection (e.g., see Fig. 1).

When performing this action, the mat may or may not be removed from the agar. This distinguishes cells that adhere to the plastic from cells that adhere to the agar.

Wild-type cells will adhere to the plastic surface and will be violet in color. In contrast, flo11Δ cells will not adhere, leaving a transparent plastic surface that is relatively free of cells.
