Expression of cell-membrane-targeted fluorescent proteins (e.g., memGFP) provides an excellent means for examining cell morphology in living tissues.

i. Inject 60-500 pg of mRNA for visualization at gastrula stages.

:AP1i

* Anchored Note, page 3
Because overexpression can lead to ectopic or abnormal protein localization, care should be taken to inject the lowest dose of mRNA that allows visualization of the construct. A careful dose-curve experiment should be performed to determine the proper expression level empirically before proceeding. Injections of 15-75 pg of mRNA are typical, but concentrations as low as 5 pg or as high as 500 pg might be needed.

Because plasmid DNA is not transcribed until after the mid-blastula transition, this approach avoids early expression of the marker gene, which might be desirable. Moreover, expression levels will vary from cell to cell using this approach

iv. Inject again at a later cleavage stage to manipulate gene function in only a subset of cells expressing the reporter. In this later injection, include both the morpholino-oligonucleotide or mRNAs to manipulate gene function and also a complementary lineage tracer to mark the manipulated cells.

These methods for mounting and imaging are also effective for fixed embryos following immunostaining or in situ hybridization, provided that clearing is not required. For imaging cleared embryos, see Preparation of Fixed Xenopus Embryos for Confocal Imaging (Wallingford 2010b).

iii. Devitellinize embryos. Place them into the wells such that the surface of interest can be imaged (e.g., the neural plate during neural tube closure [Lee et al. 2007; Kieserman et al. 2008]; the animal cap of blastula stages in whole mounts [Woolner et al. 2008]).

Take care to position the embryo as close as possible to the cover glass bottom to accommodate the working distance of the objective. Also, the less agarose between sample and objective, the better. This method is effective for imaging up to 6 h.

The epidermis of tailbud and tadpole stage Xenopus embryos is an excellent in vivo model for studying epithelial biology (Hayes et al. 2007; Kieserman et al. 2008; Park et al. 2008). Imaging this tissue also uses the specialized chamber, but involves a different mounting approach (Fig. 7B). This approach is also effective for long-term time-lapse analysis (>12 h).

When setting up the imaging parameters, a critical consideration is the balance between photobleaching and the brightness of the sample. To err on the side of caution with regard to photobleaching, decrease the laser power and then compensate by increasing the detector gain or increase the brightness post-acquisition; care must be taken with post-acquisition processing (see Step 6). At high magnification, one can reliably image to a depth of only about one cell diameter. Higher laser power can add depth, but is clearly phototoxic. In some cases (usually at lower magnifications), bright signals underneath unlabeled cells can be imaged clearly. For example, the crawling myeloid cells in Figure 2 are labeled and imaged through two to three layers of unlabeled epidermal cells. Imaging deeper tissues can almost always be achieved by imaging the cells in organotypic culture (see Discussion).

The size of stacks, the amount of overlap between the slices within stacks (z-resolution), and the collection times (time-resolution) must be optimized empirically for your specimen, fluorophore, and application

For long-term imaging of tadpole stages, add a solution of 0.15% Tricaine to the medium to prevent twitching of the embryo.

6. With careful imaging, little or no post-acquisition processing is needed. If necessary, however, perform image processing to improve the image for the computer screen and printed page:

a

* Anchored Note, page 7
Many journals now request that all original, unprocessed images be deposited with the journal. The original files MUST therefore be saved. ALWAYS create a renamed copy of images before any processing is performed (e.g., by adding “_PROCx” to the original file, where x is a number; different iterations of the processing thus get consecutively higher numbers) and perform enhancements on the renamed copy. Always apply filters and enhancements to the entire image. NEVER apply enhancements or filters to selected regions of an image. Like imaging, post-processing is most effective if trial and error is used.
