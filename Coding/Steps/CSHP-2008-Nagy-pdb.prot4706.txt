1. Trypsinize cells that have been growing in tissue culture dishes with or without pretreatment with a mitoic arrestant. Pipette to give a single cell suspension. Add medium and serum and centrifuge at 1000 rpm in a 2-mL conical glass tube for 5 min.

2. Resuspend the cell pellet gently in 1 mL of aqueous 0.56% (w/v) KCl by adding drops and flick- ing the tube. Do not pipette up and down. Add more KCl to a final volume of 4 mL. Leave at room temperature (21°C-23°C) for 6 min to swell the cells.

3. Centrifuge the cells again at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Carefully remove the supernatant, and fix the cell pellet in 1 mL of fresh Carnoy’s fixative at room temperature. Resuspend by flicking the tube. Make up to 4 mL. Then centrifuge to pellet the cells. Repeat three times.

4. Centrifuge the cells at 1000 rpm for 5 min and then resuspend them in a small volume (0.5 mL) of fixative.

Slide preparations (see below) are best made within 0-3 h of the final fixation of the cells, but they can be made up to 7 d afterward if the material is kept at 4°C and the cell pellet is resuspended in fresh fixative before attempting to spread the cells. The longer the material is kept, the poorer the spreading quality of the mitotic cells. If possible, at least five slides should be made from each sample to guarantee success.

5. Clean commercially purchased, precleaned slides further by leaving them overnight in a mixture of absolute ethanol and concentrated HCl (1:1). The next day, wash the slides in running tap water, rinse in deionized H2O, and store in absolute ethanol and diethyl ether (1:1).

6. Shortly before using the slides, use forceps to remove slides from the mixture of absolute alcohol and diethyl either. Wipe the slides dry on Kimwipes or some other coarse, grease-free tissues, avoiding finger contact with the slide to prevent making fingerprints on the slide surfaces.

7. To make chromosome spreads on these slides, add a row of three drops of cell suspension from a prepared Pasteur pipette (~0.2-mL capacity, drawn to deliver 10-μL drops), allowing them to spread to their maximum size. Let the drops dry until interference rings are visible at their periph- ery. Drying can be assisted by blowing on the slide while holding it up to the heat generated by a desk lamp bulb.

8. Once dry, inspect the slides under low-power phase-contrast microscopy (final magnification 160X). If the density of cells and chromosome spreads is insufficient, pellet the cells, resuspend in a smaller volume of fixative, and repeat with fresh drops.

9. For counting chromosomes without banding, stain in Giemsa for ~15 min and photograph with green filter.

0. Place suitably aged slides (see note below) in 2X SSC in a Coplin staining jar with a lid in a water bath at 60°C-65°C for 1.5 h. Then cool the slides to room temperature by running tap water over the closed jar. Transfer the slides to 0.85% (w/v) NaCl at room temperature for 5 min.

:AP1aix

Before G banding, slides should be “aged” for between 3 and 21 d by leaving them in a closed box at room tem- perature. Fresh slides give poor G-band resolution.

a

* Anchored Note, page 3
Maximum G-band resolution is achieved at ~10 d after slide preparation.

i

* Anchored Note, page 3
Beyond this time, resolution slowly decreases until, after several weeks in storage, the chromosomes either fail to band and stain uniformly or show “pseudobands” that are not significant to the standard idiogram.

11. Drain the slides by touching them onto filter paper. Place them on a flat surface and flood the chamber with 0.025% trypsin in 0.85% NaCl for 15-20 sec.

:AP1air(x)

* Anchored Note, page 3
The trypsin exposure time is critical: Underexposure preserves chromosome morphology but gives poorly differ- entiated bands, and overexposure distorts morphology and eliminates most of the bands. Optimum trypsin times are known to vary among laboratories.

i

* Anchored Note, page 3
A test slide should be treated for the minimal suggested time of 15 sec to establish the best treatment time for the rest of the slides.

a

* Anchored Note, page 3
In the laboratory of E.P. Evans, the optimal trypsin exposure time has been established as between 15 and 20 sec for mouse chromosomes, irrespective of the source of the mitotic cells.

12. Stop tryptic activity by placing the slides back into 0.85% NaCl. Then rinse slides in phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and stain in fresh Giemsa stain in 5 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). After 10 min in the stain, monitor wet slides under low-power, bright-field microscopy (160X) for staining inten- sity. Because, upon drying, wet slides gain contrast, care should be taken not to overstain the cells as this will reduce G-band differentiation. If necessary, repeat staining until adequate results are achieved and then quickly rinse slides in phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and blow-dry with a current of cool air.

13. Examine unmounted slides with a 100X oil-immersion lens.

:AV3aiv

* Anchored Note, page 3
The majority of modern, readily available immersion oils that are declared “PCB-free” also have the unfortunate property of removing Giemsa stain after a few hours of exposure.

i

* Anchored Note, page 3
Although direct viewing of slides under an oil immersion lens gives a higher optical resolution, it is wise to mount slides if they are to be kept.
