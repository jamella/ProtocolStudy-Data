The RQPS probe is linear DNA consisting of two physically linked DNA sequences, one of which corresponds to part of the query gene and the other to the reference gene, each with a SNV to differentiate the probe from the correspon- ding part of the genome (see Fig. 2).

1. Select a gene/genomic locus with a known CN in the genome as the reference gene.

:DS3a

* Anchored Note, page 3
Although any gene/genomic locus can be used as a reference, it is best to use genes unlikely to have CNV or SNPs among individuals, such as the exons of the genes that will give phenotypes in case of amplification or loss of heterozygosity. We routinely use mouse and human Notch2 as reference genes in our studies. SRY is another (haploid) possibility in males.

The amount of TE to use depends on the amount of genomic DNA. Because the reference and query fragments that will be amplified for pyrosequencing are very short, shearing of genomic DNA by vortexing is not a concern and is probably beneficial.

Theoretically, one mixture should be enough to derive the copy number of the query sequence. However, to assess the quality of data with an R2 value (see Step 52), it is highly recommended to use at least two different mixtures. It is NOT necessary to achieve an exact 1:1 or 2:1 ratio in the mixture, because this ratio will be measured by the pyrosequencing reactions in the following steps.

A pyrosequencing reaction needs to be done on single-stranded DNA template. This can be achieved easily by labeling one strand of PCR product with biotin (Steps 30 and 31), followed by streptavidin-mediated, single-strand purifica- tion (Steps 32-40). To reduce the cost, a three-primer PCR system is employed, in which one primer is tailed with a common motif that can be bound by a UBP. (Fig. 2; Fakhrai-Rad et al. 2002).

It is important to shut off the vacuum JUST before the tips touch the surface of the liquid in the PyroMark Q96 Plate. If it is shut off too early, the beads may be lost or fall to other wells; if it is not shut off when it touches the liquid, some or all of the liquid will be aspirated.
