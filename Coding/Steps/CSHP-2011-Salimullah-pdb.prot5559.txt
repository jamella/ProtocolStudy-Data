If the total RNA is in a larger volume, reduce to 2 μL by centrifugal evaporation at room temperature (to avoid RNA degradation).

Checking the reverse transcription is not recommended at this step, because this will reduce the amount of cDNAs for PCR amplification and therefore increase the number of cycles needed.

This removes smaller artifacts and primer dimers from the cDNAs that can make it difficult to determine the number of PCR cycles required for semisuppressive PCR.
