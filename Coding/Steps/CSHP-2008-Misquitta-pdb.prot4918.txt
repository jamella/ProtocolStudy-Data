i. Set heat at 12.5-13.0 and set the solenoid at 4 on the needle puller.

ii. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for pulling the needles.

iii. Store freshly-pulled needles horizontally, embedded lightly on a flattened narrow strip of modeling clay placed on the bottom of a 150-mm covered plastic Petri dish.

2. Use a pipette (e.g., Eppendorf P10) fitted with a microtip (e.g., Eppendorf Microloader tips) to back-load the injection needles with 0.5-1.0 μL of dsRNA mixed with filtered food dye.

3. Set the Transjector to automatic injection.

4. Set the injection pressure (Po) to 450.

5. Set the compensation pressure (Pc) to 570.

6. Set the time of injections to 0.1 sec.

If using a different model injector, calibrate the injector according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Based on the volume loaded into the needle (0.5-1.0 μL), each embryo receives up to 100-200 pL of dsRNA. A typical load- ing, if the needle remains unbroken and unblocked, is good for the injection of approximately 1000 embryos or more.

Inject the embryos in the posterior end, slightly off-center, because the posterior tip of the chorion is very hard and needles often break in this position. Keep the injection room at 18°C to slow development.

i. Move the slide slowly toward the needle tip while simultaneously depressing the “clean” button on the Transjector.

:AP1

* Anchored Note, page 3
ii. The moment that the slide lightly taps the tip and the tip breaks, a small amount of the dye will leak from the needle tip. Release the “clean” button.

:AP1ex

* Anchored Note, page 3
Dye flow should stop when the “clean” button is no longer depressed.

e

* Anchored Note, page 3
If the tip is too large after breakage, the needle will continue to drip dye when the “clean” button is not depressed. Such tips will destroy the embryos during injection.

8. Bring the needle tip and the posterior tip of the embryo into the same focal plane. Make sure that the needle is positioned off-center with respect to the posterior tip of the embryo (see Fig. 1).

For best results, inject the embryos with the needle at an angle slightly greater than 45° relative to the embryo surface in the posterior quarter of the embryo.

9. Insert the needle just far enough to penetrate the vitelline membrane.

10. Inject the RNA into the embryo. A small amount of food dye will appear as a small dot in the posterior end of the embryo. It takes ~1-5 sec to inject each embryo.

11. After all the embryos on a slide have been injected, place the slide in a covered moist chamber at 18oC-22oC until embryogenesis is complete (~48 h) or until the desired stage of development is reached.

12. Wash the embryos off the slide into a nylon-mesh collection basket.

13. Transfer the embryos to a microcentrifuge tube.

14. Fix the embryos and stain them using standard protocols; see Ashburner (1989a,b).
