1. Collect the embryos in PBS or tissue culture medium.

:AP1a

If the embryos are at the prestreak to early somite stages, it is advisable to add some serum (~5%) to reduce stickiness (this will cause a protein precipitate in the fixative, but do not be concerned).

2. Dissect away the extraembryonic membranes to facilitate penetration of the antibodies.

i. For early somite-stage mouse embryos (up to ~eight somites), use the tips of fine forceps to flatten the embryo by pushing the edges of the visceral yolk sac into the surface of a plastic Petri dish.

By “pinning out” the embryos in this way, they can be fixed flat and will remain extended after being detached from the dish. The extended shape allows better viewing of the somites and neural tube after staining.

ii. For older embryos (9.5-10.5 d), it is sometimes best to cut them in half sagitally before or after fixation.

This makes it easier to visualize and photograph staining of bilaterally symmetrical structures such as the cranial nerves, which otherwise appear as “double images.”

3. Fix the embryos in freshly prepared methanol/DMSO (4:1) at 4°C overnight.

4. Transfer the embryos into freshly prepared methanol/DMSO/H2O2 (4:1:1) at room temperature for 5-10 h.

:AP1i

This blocks endogenous peroxidase activity (e.g., in red blood cells).

The embryos may be stored for at least several months and probably longer.

i. Add 1 mL of 50% methanol and incubate for 30 min with rocking. Remove the solution with a Pasteur pipette or micropipette.

If embryos stick to the sides, siliconize the tubes.

iii. Add 1 mL of PBSMT and incubate for 1 h with rocking (do this twice, removing the solu- tion after each wash).

:AP1ix

* Anchored Note, page 3
Rocking is important to facilitate penetration of the antibody: Ensure that the solution is mixing well.

i

* Anchored Note, page 3
However, the embryos are fragile once they are fixed, so do not rock them too hard.

7. Add 1 mL of primary antibody diluted in PBSMT. Incubate the embryos overnight at 4°C with rocking.

:AP1ai

* Anchored Note, page 3
If the antibody is stable, this and all subsequent procedures can be performed at room temperature.

i

* Anchored Note, page 3
The correct dilution must be determined empirically, but 1:200 is a typical dilution.

9. Transfer the embryos to microcentrifuge tubes. Add 1 mL of secondary antibody diluted 1:500 in PBSMT, and incubate them overnight at 4°C with rocking.

10. Wash the embryos again as in Step 8.

11. Rinse the embryos in 5 mL of PBTX, and then transfer them to microcentrifuge tubes. Wash them in 1 mL of PBTX with rocking for 20 min.

12. Incubate the embryos in microcentrifuge tubes with 1 mL of DAB-NiCl2 at room temperature for 30 min.

This allows full penetration of the substrate into the embryo.

13. Add H2O2 to a final concentration of 0.03% and rock until the color intensity in the embryos looks good (i.e., specific regions of staining are obvious and before background staining comes up; usu- ally 2-10 min).

:AP2a

* Anchored Note, page 3
If necessary, check color in the dissecting microscope. If the color reaction occurs too quickly, use a lower con- centration of H2O2.

a

14. Post-fix the embryos in 4% paraformaldehyde.

:AP1i

* Anchored Note, page 3
Without post-fixation, the color of the stained embryos will fade under strong light, particularly under light used for photography.

16. Remove the methanol, add 500 μL of BABB, and rock for 10 min. Make observations of the stained embryos in a glass Petri dish (do not use polystyrene dishes). For photography, place embryos in a depression slide with a coverslip on top. Use a tungsten color film without filters or a daylight color film with a blue filter.
