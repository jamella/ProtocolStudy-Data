1. Using microloaders, fill the chosen pipettes with 5-10 Î¼L of the appropriate dye-containing solution.

Do not use syringe needles to load the pipettes because these may release heavy metals.

2. Use standard techniques to lower the pipette into the recording chamber containing the chosen slice. Apply positive pressure to prevent dust floating on the surface from entering the pipette.

3. Once the pipette tip is in the standard external saline, set the positive pressure to a level that prevents the ejection of too much dye (see Fig. 1A).

4. Apply a brief pulse of stronger pressure immediately before seal formation to clean the surface of the cell.

5. Perform seal formation and establish the whole-cell configuration as per standard electrophysio- logical recordings

mmediately after the patch is ruptured, the dye will start to diffuse into the cell. The time required to reach a certain cytosolic dye concentration will depend on the mobility of the dye molecule, the dye concentration in the pipette, the series resistance (Rs) of the pipette, and the cell geometry.
