Because experimental designs may vary substantially (see Szyjka et. al. [2008]; Knott et al. [2009a]), we describe only the addition of BrdU to the growth medium and cell harvesting. For the reference DNA sample (to be fluorescently labeled and cohybridized onto the microarray with the IP DNA), we typically use genomic DNA prepared from G1-arrested cells (not labeled with BrdU). However, BrdU-labeled DNA may be used, and DNA from different cell cycle stages or time points may be used. For the former, genomic DNA from 10-20 mL of G1-arrested cells (OD600~ 0.5-1.0) should be prepared (Steps 3-22) in parallel with BrdU-incorporated genomic DNA. For the latter, 1 ug of BrdU-incorporated genomic DNA obtained at Step 20 is used. In both cases, reference DNA should be amplified to account for potential differences in amplification efficiencies of different sequences.

In these steps, BrdU-labeled genomic DNA that has been isolated and sheared is denatured and immunoprecipitated using an antibody specific to BrdU. Reference DNA is not subjected to this procedure and is set aside until the amplification in Steps 35-38. If immunoprecipitated DNA is to be analyzed with high-throughput sequencing, we do not recommend a blocking step (see below), because it uses nonhomologous DNA that may remain in the immuno- precipitated sample and complicate sequencing analysis. Instead, we suggest the use of Dynabeads Protein G, which does not require blocking.

The Klenow extension reaction in this step further amplifies the DNA samples. This amplification is dependent on several factors, including the Cy-conjugated random 9-mer primer concentration and the amount of Klenow used.

i

* Anchored Note, page 6
We have found that hybridizations can be performed using less labeled DNA without significantly affecting the data quality; therefore, if desired, in this step both Klenow enzyme and primers can be conserved. However, scaling back on these reagents results in lower amounts of amplified DNA. We have found that a typical reaction to label 1 μg of DNA using primers at OD = 1.0 and 100 U of Klenow produces >20 μg of labeled DNA; using primers at OD = 0.1 and 100 U of Klenow produces ~5 μg of DNA; using primers at OD = 0.1 and 50 U of Klenow produces ~3 μg of DNA.
