The analysis described in this procedure must be conducted on yeast cells that have been engineered to assimilate BrdU from the growth medium and incorporate it into DNA. This can be accomplished in yeast by overexpressing herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase to phosphorylate nucleosides (Lengronne et al. 2001)

Use the NimbleGen Dual-Color DNA Labeling Kit (or similar) to label the IP DNA with Cy5 andreference DNA with Cy3 according to the manufacturer’s instructions.The Klenow extension reaction in this step further amplifies the DNA samples. This amplification is dependent on several factors, including the Cy-conjugated random 9-mer primer concentration and the amount of Klenow used. We have found that hybridizations can be performed using less labeled DNA
