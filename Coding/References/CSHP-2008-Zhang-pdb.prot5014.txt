This method of patch clamping Arabidopsis guard cell protoplasts was adapted from one used for iso- lation and patch clamping of Vicia faba guard cell protoplasts (Schroeder et al. 1984; Assmann et al. 1985; Kruse et al. 1989);

Pei et al. (1997) describe an alternative method to isolate Arabidopsis guard cell protoplasts suitable for patch clamping.

Another two-step pro- tocol for large-scale isolation of Arabidopsis guard cell protoplasts has also been described (Leonhardt et al. 2004).
