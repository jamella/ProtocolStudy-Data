However, BrdU-labeled DNA may be used, and DNA from different cell cycle stages or time points may be used. For the former, genomic DNA from 10-20 mL of G1-arrested cells (OD600~ 0.5-1.0) should be prepared (Steps 3-22) in parallel with BrdU-incorporated genomic DNA. For the latter, 1 ug of BrdU-incorporated genomic DNA obtained at Step 20 is used.

At high magnification, one can reliably image to a depth of only about one cell diameter. Higher laser power can add depth, but is clearly phototoxic. In some cases (usually at lower magnifications), bright signals underneath unlabeled cells can be imaged clearly.
